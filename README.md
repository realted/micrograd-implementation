# micrograd-implementation
Implementation of Micrograd created by Andrej Kaparthy

The purpose of this project was to learn the concept of backpropagation, gradient descent, and loss minimization from Andrej Kaparthy's Neural Network series. 

In the file "sample_NN_draft", a fully annotated process of how a Neural Network is trained is shown. This helped me to understand each step of the process, and how parameter tuning works, better than any University leveled ML course I have taken so far. 

This project was a blast.
